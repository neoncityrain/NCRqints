  "Title": "Questionable Intentions Campaigns",
  "Description": "[b]These are custom campaigns.[/b] As such, no information should be necessary to know before playing.\r\nThis mod adds two slugcats: the Entropy and the Marauder. Both are intended to be semi-difficult to play and to [i]allow the player to take different approaches to existing locations.[/i]\r\n\r\nI am not a coder, I am a single person, there will be issues.\r\nI am not associated with Nyctophobia. Witness and Entropy have a very similar ability. This is not intentional.\r\nThis mod works with DMS, and automatically sets the skins of the characters to their default. It works without it as well, though Marauder is missing their patterns.\r\n\r\nGITHUB: https://github.com/neoncityrain/Questionable-Intentions-Campaigns\r\n\r\n[img]https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/75958273_kToAMphNGgKCI6R.png[/img][img]https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/75955322_6VOxS6hXLu5UUwc.png[/img]\r\n\r\n[h1]Before you comment:[/h1]\r\nRefrain from comparisons to other creations.\r\nNeither campaign is completed to its entirety.\r\nPlease disable other custom slugcat mods to play. The game WILL crash with some of them enabled; I am not entirely sure which.\r\nDon\u0027t comment about what you want changed about this mod unless it is AN ERROR. I am not taking criticism at this time, do not offer it.*\r\nIs it mean? Consider not saying anything instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*If you want to offer help, especially with coding, I\u0027d appreciate it- otherwise, keep it to yourself.",
