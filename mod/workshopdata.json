  "Title": "Questionable Intentions Campaigns",
  "Description": "[b]These are custom campaigns.[/b] As such, no information should be necessary to know before playing./nThis mod adds two slugcats: the Entropy and the Marauder. Both are intended to be difficult to play./n/nI am not a coder, I am a single person, there will be issues./nI am not associated with Nyctophobia. Witness and Entropy have a very similar ability. This is not intentional./nThis mod does work with DMS, and automatically sets the skins of the characters to their default./n[img]https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/75958273_kToAMphNGgKCI6R.png[/img][img]https://f2.toyhou.se/file/f2-toyhou-se/images/75955322_6VOxS6hXLu5UUwc.png[/img]/n/n[h1]Before you comment:[/h1]/nRefrain from comparisons to other creations./nNeither campaign is completed to its entirety./nPlease disable other custom slugcat mods to play. The game WILL crash with some of them enabled; I am not entirely sure which./nDon't comment about what you want changed about this mod unless it is AN ERROR. I am not taking criticism at this time, do not offer it.*/nIs it mean? Consider not saying anything instead./n/n/n*If you want to offer help, especially with coding, I'd appreciate it- otherwise, keep it to yourself.",
