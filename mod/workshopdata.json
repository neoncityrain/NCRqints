  "Description": "A little slugpup awakens in a chaotic new place...\r\n[b]This is a custom campaign.[/b] As such, no information is necessary to know before playing.\r\nFor more information, check [url=https://rainworldmods.miraheze.org/wiki/Entropy]Entropy's wiki page[/url]. To see more of its gallery, check [url=https://toyhou.se/23744691.entropy]their Toyhouse[/url].\r\n\n\n- I am not associated with Nyctophobia. Witness and Entropy have (or will have?) a very similar ability; this is not intentional.\n- This campaign is not based on anything but Rain World. I do not know Fallout or Entropy Zero references. They get old very fast, refrain from bringing them up please.",
