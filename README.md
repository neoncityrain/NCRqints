This is a Rain World mod called **"Questionable Intentions."** Its goal is to bring campaigns to players that allow them to re-explore, encounter new challenges, and play in a different style than they ordinarily would. It is not meant to be canon; it is meant to be fun to play.

# FAQ
Can you change...
> Not unless it's a bug. This mod is still a work in progress; it is not completed. Therefore, what you see is not its final vision. _Don't give suggestions on what to change or unwanted criticism!_ I am not in a good place for it.

Are these campaigns easy?
> No. They are intended to be at least _somewhat_ challenging.

I found a secret! What do I do about it?
> Enjoy it! I'd love to know if you found something- I've purposefully hidden a few things and would like to hide even more.

I found a bug, what do I do?
> You're encouraged to either open an issue on this Github or let me know somewhere else. However, I am not a coder- I can't always fix it immediately, so keep that in mind.

Can I help?
> Sure! I need lots of help with coding in particular. Just let me know beforehand- I can tell you what I need help with.
